Given-When-Then Unit Tests -- G/W/T --- AAA Assemble A...? Assert?

Given a Deck object
-
Then it has 52 cards

APPROACH A

Given the two of hearts and a guess that it is red
When we verify the guess
Then we get true

Given the two of hearts and a guess that it is black
When we verify the guess
Then we get false

APPROACH B

Given the two of hearts
When we guess that it is red
Then we get true



APPROACH A:
class Guess {
  public boolean isTrueFor(Card c) { ... }
}
A.1
class HighLowGuess {
  public boolean isTrueFor(Card c) { ... }
}
A.2
class HighGuess {
 public boolean isTrueFor(Card c) { ... }
}
class LowGuess {
 public boolean isTrueFor(Card c) { ... }
}


APPROACH B:
class Card {
  public boolean guessColor(Color c) { ... }

  public boolean guessIsHigher(Rank r) { ... }
}


SEPARABLE MODEL ARCHITECTURE  -- humble view

MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER -- FXML (there are videos on this)
 - It's possible to unit test controller (sometimes)

 ...
 Assertions.assertTrue(c.guessColor(Color.RED))
